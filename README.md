# Shotgun Sequencing Analysis of the Gut Microbiome in Colorectal Cancer Patients


## Aim
 - Reveal the microbial composition and ecological changes in patients with colorectal cancer  
 - Characterize microbial implicates in Colorectal Cancer infections using shotgun metagenomics approach  
 - Predict conserved bacterial functions using in-silico bacterial metagenomic analysis  

## Methodology
 - Collect WGS samples of CRC patients and healthy individuals
 - Quality control
 - Trimming
 - Remove Redundant Genes 
 - Gene Prediction
 - Quantification
 - Binning
 - Identification, Annotation, and Visualization of gene clusters
 - Taxonomic and functional information
